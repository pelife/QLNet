# Contributing to QLNet

Love QLNet and want to help? Thanks so much, there's something to do for everybody!

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/amaggiulli/qlnet/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs), [features requests](#features)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests).

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash;

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS
experience the problem? What version of .NET Framework ? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the .NET/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.


<a name="pull-requests"></a>
## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation,
accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work
included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/qlnet.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd qlnet
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/amaggiulli/qlnet.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b some-feature develop
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to the project git commit message guideline or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream develop
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

To help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/amaggiulli/qlnet/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:"good+first+issue") that contain bugs that have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.

If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don’t accidentally duplicate your effort.

If somebody claims an issue but doesn’t follow up for more than two weeks, it’s fine to take over it but you should still leave a comment.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project
owners to license your work under the terms of the [BSD3 License](https://github.com/amaggiulli/QLNet/blob/develop/LICENSE).
